    <p class="artist-statement">hiiiii. im abby sullivan and im an aspiring designer from the east coast. I like otters and iced coffee and my journal and saving things as pngs. stars are my favorite shape and i love dotted lines. if everything i make looks like it was just printed on ur dads canon in the basement of your childhood home i would be content. (my dad never had a printer either but its more in the energy of the style). i like the multiply blend setting and photoshop filters. if you want your own poster, website, aura, band tshirt designed by me, reach out here: asull1@saic.edu</p>
